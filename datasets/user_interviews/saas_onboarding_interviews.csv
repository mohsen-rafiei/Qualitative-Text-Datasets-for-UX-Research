P001,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I mean, honestly? I was expecting it to be pretty straightforward. Like, sign up, maybe watch a quick tutorial, and then I'm good to go. But there's so much... stuff. I don't even know where to start. It's overwhelming, you know?",25-34,Marketing Manager,Intermediate
P002,task_walkthrough,first_login,"Okay so I logged in and there's this dashboard thing. It's got like 20 different sections and I'm just sitting here like... what am I supposed to do first? There's no clear path. I clicked around for maybe 10 minutes before I gave up and just started clicking random things.",35-44,Product Manager,Advanced
P003,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The onboarding was... fine? I guess? But I feel like I'm missing something. Like, they showed me how to create a project, but not WHY I would want to create a project, or what happens after. It's very feature-focused, not goal-focused.",25-34,Designer,Intermediate
P004,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I had no idea this feature even existed until I accidentally stumbled on it. And it's actually really useful! But why wasn't it mentioned in the onboarding? I've been using the tool for three weeks and I'm still finding new things.",35-44,Operations Lead,Advanced
P005,reflection,overall_experience,"I'm frustrated, honestly. I know this tool can do what I need, but I feel like I'm fighting against it instead of it helping me. Every time I try to do something, I have to Google how to do it or ask support. That shouldn't be necessary.",25-34,Content Creator,Beginner
P006,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I've used similar tools before, so I thought I knew what to expect. But this one is... different. In a good way, I think? But also confusing because my mental model doesn't match.",35-44,Engineering Manager,Advanced
P007,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The welcome screen was nice, I'll give them that. But then it just... stopped. Like, here's your dashboard, figure it out. I wish there was a way to say 'hey, I'm new, show me around' or 'I know what I'm doing, skip this'.",25-34,Marketing Coordinator,Beginner
P008,reflection,onboarding_flow,"I liked the interactive tutorial, but it disappeared too fast. And I couldn't go back to it later. So now I'm stuck trying to remember what it said, and I'm probably doing things wrong.",18-24,Student,Beginner
P009,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"There are so many features hidden in menus. I feel like I'm using maybe 20% of what this tool can do, but I don't know what the other 80% is or if I even need it. A feature discovery thing would be helpful.",35-44,Consultant,Intermediate
P010,reflection,overall_experience,"It's growing on me. The first week was rough, but now that I've figured out the basics, I can see the value. I just wish the learning curve wasn't so steep at the beginning.",25-34,Project Manager,Intermediate
P011,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I watched a demo video before signing up, and it looked amazing. But the actual experience is... not the same. The video made it seem intuitive, but in practice, everything feels buried.",35-44,Director,Advanced
P012,task_walkthrough,first_login,"I got stuck on the email verification step. The email went to spam, so I waited like an hour before checking. Then when I finally got in, I had no idea what to do next. The momentum was gone.",25-34,Analyst,Intermediate
P013,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The tooltips are helpful, but there are too many of them. It's like death by a thousand tooltips. I started ignoring them after the first five, so I probably missed important information.",18-24,Intern,Beginner
P014,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I wish there was a 'most common tasks' section or something. Like, 'here's what 80% of users do first' or 'start here if you want to do X'. Right now it's just... everything at once.",35-44,VP,Advanced
P015,reflection,overall_experience,"I'm actually really impressed. Once you get past the initial confusion, it's powerful. But I can see why people would give up before they get to that point. The barrier to entry is high.",25-34,Manager,Intermediate
P016,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I expected it to be complicated because it's enterprise software, but I didn't expect it to be THIS complicated. There's a difference between powerful and overwhelming.",45-54,Executive,Advanced
P017,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The login process itself was fine, but then there's this whole setup wizard that I couldn't skip. I just wanted to explore, but it forced me through 15 steps before I could actually use anything.",25-34,Coordinator,Beginner
P018,reflection,onboarding_flow,"I appreciate that they're trying to help, but the onboarding feels like it was designed for someone who's never used software before. I'm not a beginner, but I'm being treated like one.",35-44,Senior Manager,Advanced
P019,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I found this really cool feature by accident, and it's exactly what I needed. But I've been using the tool for a month and I'm just now finding it. That's a problem.",25-34,Specialist,Intermediate
P020,reflection,overall_experience,"Mixed feelings. The tool itself is great, but the onboarding experience left a bad first impression. I almost canceled my trial because of it. Glad I stuck with it, but they're losing users at this stage.",35-44,Lead,Advanced
P021,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I thought it would be plug-and-play, but it's more like... plug and configure and read documentation and watch videos and then maybe play?",25-34,Marketing Specialist,Intermediate
P022,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The dashboard is beautiful, I'll give them that. But beautiful doesn't mean usable. I spent 20 minutes just trying to figure out where my data was.",18-24,Junior Analyst,Beginner
P023,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The step-by-step guide was helpful, but it assumed I knew what all these terms meant. Like, 'configure your workspace' - what does that even mean? I had to look it up.",25-34,Coordinator,Beginner
P024,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"There's a search function, which is good, but it doesn't always find what I'm looking for. And sometimes I don't know what to search for because I don't know what the feature is called.",35-44,Manager,Intermediate
P025,reflection,overall_experience,"I'm getting there. It's not intuitive, but it's learnable. I just wish the learning happened faster. I feel like I'm wasting time that I could be spending on actual work.",25-34,Individual Contributor,Intermediate
P026,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I've been burned by bad onboarding before, so I went in with low expectations. And... yeah, it met those expectations. Not terrible, but not great either.",35-44,Director,Advanced
P027,task_walkthrough,first_login,"I liked that I could choose my role during signup - that was smart. But then the onboarding didn't really change based on my role. It was still generic.",25-34,Product Owner,Intermediate
P028,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The video tutorials are well-made, but I don't want to watch a 10-minute video every time I want to learn something. I want contextual help, right when I need it.",18-24,Student,Beginner
P029,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I wish there was a way to see what other users in my role typically do. Like, 'other marketing managers usually start with X, Y, Z'. That would be helpful.",35-44,Marketing Director,Advanced
P030,reflection,overall_experience,"It's fine. Not amazing, not terrible. Just... fine. I'll use it because I have to, but I'm not excited about it. And that's probably not what they want to hear.",25-34,Manager,Intermediate
P031,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I expected a modern, streamlined experience based on the marketing. But it feels like they built all these features and then just... dumped them on the screen. No curation.",35-44,VP,Advanced
P032,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The first thing I saw was a blank dashboard with a 'get started' button. I clicked it, and it took me to another page with more buttons. It's buttons all the way down.",25-34,Analyst,Intermediate
P033,reflection,onboarding_flow,"I appreciate the effort, but the onboarding feels disconnected from the actual product. Like, they show you simplified examples, but then the real thing is completely different.",18-24,Junior,Beginner
P034,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"There's a help center, which is good. But I have to leave the app to use it, and by the time I find what I need, I've forgotten what I was trying to do in the first place.",35-44,Senior Manager,Advanced
P035,reflection,overall_experience,"I'm frustrated because I can see the potential, but I can't unlock it. It's like having a powerful car but not knowing how to drive stick. The tool is there, but I'm not skilled enough to use it effectively.",25-34,Individual Contributor,Intermediate
P036,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I thought it would be similar to [competitor tool], but it's actually quite different. That's not necessarily bad, but it means I can't rely on my existing knowledge.",35-44,Consultant,Advanced
P037,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The signup was quick, which I liked. But then there's this huge gap between signing up and actually being productive. Like, okay, I'm in, now what?",25-34,Coordinator,Beginner
P038,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The interactive walkthrough was helpful, but it was too fast. I couldn't process everything before it moved on. And there's no way to slow it down or pause it.",18-24,Intern,Beginner
P039,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I keep finding features that I didn't know existed, and they're solving problems I didn't even know I had. That's cool, but also frustrating because I've been working around these problems for weeks.",35-44,Director,Advanced
P040,reflection,overall_experience,"It's a learning curve, for sure. But I think once I get comfortable, it'll be worth it. The question is whether I'll stick around long enough to get comfortable.",25-34,Manager,Intermediate
P041,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I expected it to be complex because it's a professional tool, but I also expected better guidance. Like, hold my hand through the complex parts, you know?",35-44,Executive,Advanced
P042,task_walkthrough,first_login,"I got through the onboarding, but I'm not confident I did it right. Like, did I set things up correctly? Am I missing something important? There's no way to know.",25-34,Specialist,Intermediate
P043,reflection,onboarding_flow,"The onboarding covers the basics, but not the 'why'. Like, I know HOW to create a project, but I don't know WHY I would want to, or when, or what happens next.",18-24,Student,Beginner
P044,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"I wish there was a 'new user checklist' or something. Like, 'here are the 10 things you should do in your first week'. Right now I'm just guessing.",35-44,Lead,Advanced
P045,reflection,overall_experience,"I'm torn. The tool is powerful, but the onboarding is weak. I'm spending more time learning than doing, and that's not sustainable.",25-34,Individual Contributor,Intermediate
P046,warm_up,initial_expectations,"I went in blind, which was probably a mistake. But I also think the product should be usable even if you go in blind. That's the whole point of good UX, right?",35-44,Manager,Advanced
P047,task_walkthrough,first_login,"The welcome message was nice, but then it just... ended. Like, 'welcome! Good luck!' And I'm sitting there like, okay, now what do I do?",25-34,Coordinator,Beginner
P048,reflection,onboarding_flow,"I liked that I could skip parts of the onboarding, but I'm worried I skipped something important. There's no way to go back and check what I missed.",18-24,Junior,Beginner
P049,task_walkthrough,feature_discovery,"The UI is clean, which is good, but it also means features are hidden. I'm constantly right-clicking or hovering, trying to find things that might not even exist.",35-44,Senior Director,Advanced
P050,reflection,overall_experience,"It's getting better as I use it more, but the first impression wasn't great. And first impressions matter. I almost didn't come back after the first session.",25-34,Analyst,Intermediate
