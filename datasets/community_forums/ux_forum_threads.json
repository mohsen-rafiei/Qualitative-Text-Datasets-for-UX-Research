      "original_post": "I'm struggling with a stakeholder who keeps asking for changes that don't make sense from a UX perspective. They want to add more features, make buttons bigger, add more colors - basically everything that goes against best practices. I've tried explaining the reasoning, showing research, but they don't listen. How do you handle this situation? I'm getting frustrated and starting to feel like I'm not doing my job well.",

          "content": "I've found that showing real user data helps. Do a quick usability test with 5 users and show them the results. When stakeholders see actual people struggling with their suggestions, they usually back down. It's harder to argue with real user behavior than with principles."

Also, remember that UX is a team sport - you don't have to know everything, you just need to know how to find answers."
