Title: "Why do product teams always prioritize features over UX?"

Post: "I'm so tired of this. Every sprint planning meeting, it's 'we need to add this feature' or 'we need to build that feature.' No one ever says 'we need to improve the UX of existing features' or 'we need to fix usability issues.' 

Features get prioritized because they're visible and measurable. UX improvements are invisible until you look closely, so they get deprioritized. But bad UX is killing our product - users are frustrated, support tickets are high, retention is low.

How do you convince product teams that UX improvements are just as important as new features? I'm losing this battle constantly."

u/ProductDesigner: "I feel you. What's worked for me is framing UX improvements as features. Instead of 'improve checkout flow,' say 'reduce checkout abandonment by 30%.' Instead of 'fix navigation,' say 'increase feature discovery by 50%.' Product teams understand features, so speak their language."

u/UXLead: "This is a classic problem. The issue is that UX improvements don't have clear ROI, while features do. You need to show the business impact. Track metrics before and after UX improvements. Show how fixing UX issues reduces support costs, increases conversion, improves retention. Data talks."

u/DesignManager: "Sometimes you have to be strategic. I've found that bundling UX improvements with new features works well. Like, 'we're adding this new feature, but we also need to improve the UX of the related features to make it work well.' It's not ideal, but it gets things done."

Title: "What's the best way to learn UX design in 2024?"

Post: "I'm looking to switch careers into UX design. I have a background in marketing, so I understand users and business, but I don't have design skills. 

There are so many resources out there - bootcamps, online courses, YouTube videos, books. I'm overwhelmed. What's actually worth it? I don't have a ton of money to spend, so I need to be strategic.

Also, do I need to learn to code? I see mixed opinions on this. Some say yes, some say no. What's the reality?"

Top Comments:

u/UXMentor: "You don't need to learn to code, but understanding how things work technically helps. Focus on: 1) Design fundamentals (typography, color, layout), 2) UX methods (research, testing, prototyping), 3) Tools (Figma, Miro, etc.), 4) Build a portfolio with real projects. Bootcamps can be good, but they're expensive. Start with free resources, then invest if you need structure."

u/SeniorDesigner: "I'm self-taught. What worked for me: 1) Read 'Don't Make Me Think' and 'The Design of Everyday Things', 2) Take free courses on Coursera or edX, 3) Redesign existing apps/websites and document your process, 4) Find a mentor, 5) Join UX communities. You don't need a bootcamp if you're disciplined."

u/DesignRecruiter: "From a hiring perspective: portfolio > education. I don't care if you went to a bootcamp or are self-taught. I care about your portfolio and your ability to think through problems. Focus on building a strong portfolio with 3-5 case studies that show your process."

Title: "How do you handle design feedback that doesn't make sense?"

Post: "I got feedback from a stakeholder that literally makes no sense. They want me to 'make it pop more' and 'add more energy' but when I ask what that means, they can't explain it. They just keep saying 'you know, make it better.'

I've tried asking clarifying questions, showing examples, explaining my design decisions, but nothing works. They just keep giving vague feedback. I'm frustrated and don't know how to move forward.

How do you handle this? Do you just do what they ask even if it doesn't make sense? Or do you push back? I'm worried about seeming difficult, but I also don't want to make bad design decisions."

Top Comments:

u/DesignVeteran: "This is so common. What I do: 1) Ask 'why' - what problem are they trying to solve? 2) Show 3 options - sometimes they don't know what they want until they see it, 3) Use data - 'based on user research, users prefer X', 4) If all else fails, do a quick version of what they want and test it. Sometimes they realize it's not what they wanted when they see it."

u/UXConsultant: "Vague feedback usually means they don't know what they want. Help them figure it out. Ask: 'What feeling do you want users to have?' 'What action do you want them to take?' 'What's not working about the current design?' Get to the root of what they're actually trying to achieve."

u/SeniorDesigner: "Sometimes you have to pick your battles. If it's not a critical decision, I'll make the change they want (even if I disagree) to build trust. Then when something important comes up, they're more likely to listen. It's about relationship building, not just design."

Title: "Is UX research actually useful or just a checkbox?"

Post: "I'm a product manager, and I'm skeptical about UX research. We do user interviews and usability tests, but I feel like we're just checking a box. The research confirms what we already know, or it's so obvious that it's not useful.

Like, we'll do a usability test and find out that users want the feature to be faster. Well, duh. Everyone wants everything to be faster. That's not actionable insight.

Am I missing something? Is UX research actually valuable, or is it just something we do to feel good about ourselves? What makes research actually useful?"

Top Comments:

u/ResearchLead: "Bad research confirms what you already know. Good research surprises you. If your research isn't revealing new insights, you're probably asking the wrong questions or testing the wrong things. Try: 1) Testing assumptions, not features, 2) Observing behavior, not asking opinions, 3) Testing early, before you've invested too much."

u/UXResearcher: "Research is only useful if you act on it. I've seen teams do research, find problems, then ignore the findings because they don't align with what they want to build. That's when research becomes a checkbox. Research should inform decisions, not just validate them."

u/ProductDesigner: "The value of research isn't always in the findings - sometimes it's in the process. Research forces you to think about users, to question assumptions, to consider alternatives. Even if the findings are obvious, the act of doing research changes how you think about the product."

Title: "How do you stay creative when you're doing the same thing every day?"

Post: "I've been working on the same product for 3 years now. I'm doing the same types of projects, solving the same types of problems, using the same design patterns. I feel like I'm in a rut. My designs are getting stale, and I'm losing motivation.

I used to love design, but now it feels like a job. I'm not excited about new projects anymore. I'm just going through the motions.

How do you stay creative and motivated when you're working on the same thing day after day? Do I need to switch jobs? Or is there a way to find inspiration in the work I'm already doing?"

Top Comments:

u/CreativeDirector: "This is burnout, and it's normal. What helps: 1) Side projects - work on something completely different, 2) Learn new skills - try a new tool or method, 3) Teach others - mentoring can reignite your passion, 4) Take breaks - sometimes you just need time away, 5) Find new challenges - ask for different types of projects or switch teams."

u/DesignVeteran: "I've been there. What helped me was changing my perspective. Instead of 'I'm designing another form,' think 'I'm solving a new problem' or 'I'm helping a user achieve a goal.' Focus on the impact, not the output. Also, try redesigning things just for fun - it keeps your skills sharp and your creativity flowing."

u/SeniorDesigner: "Sometimes you do need a change. But before switching jobs, try: 1) Switching teams or projects within your company, 2) Taking on a side project, 3) Learning something new (motion design, research, etc.), 4) Attending conferences or meetups. If none of that helps, then maybe it's time for a new role."
