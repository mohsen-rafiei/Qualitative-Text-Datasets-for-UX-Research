E001,P4001,2024-03-01,08:30:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Woke up, made coffee, checked my email on my phone while still in bed. Bad habit, I know. Then I sat down at my desk and opened Slack. Already had 47 unread messages. Felt overwhelmed before I even started. Tried to prioritize but everything feels urgent. Spent 20 minutes just catching up on what happened overnight.",frustrated,home_office
E002,P4001,2024-03-01,12:15:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Trying to focus. My partner is also working from home, and we're both on calls constantly. The walls are thin, so I can hear everything. I'm wearing noise-canceling headphones, but I can still feel the vibrations when they talk. It's distracting. I wish we had separate rooms, but our apartment is small. Maybe I should work from a coffee shop, but then I'd have to pay for coffee all day and deal with unreliable WiFi.",stressed,home_office
E003,P4001,2024-03-01,17:45:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Finally finished my main task around 4pm. Felt good to check something off. But then I realized I had three more urgent things to do. Stayed online until 6:30 trying to catch up. My back hurts from sitting all day. I need a better chair, but they're expensive. Maybe I'll ask my company to reimburse me. Doubt they will though.",tired,home_office
E004,P4002,2024-03-01,09:00:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Got up, exercised, showered, made breakfast. Tried to stick to my routine. Sat down at 9am sharp, which is when I'm supposed to start. But I'm already behind because I didn't check email over the weekend. Have 200+ unread emails. This is going to take forever. Why do people send so many emails on weekends?",overwhelmed,home_office
E005,P4002,2024-03-01,14:30:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Video calls. I've had 5 calls today already, and it's only 2:30pm. Each one could have been an email or Slack message. I'm exhausted from being 'on' all the time. My face hurts from smiling. I know people can't see me, but I still feel like I need to look engaged and friendly. It's draining.",exhausted,home_office
E006,P4002,2024-03-01,18:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Productive day overall. Got through most of my to-do list. But I'm realizing I'm working longer hours from home than I did in the office. There's no clear boundary between work and home anymore. I'm checking Slack at 8pm, answering emails on weekends. I need to set better boundaries, but it's hard when everyone else is always online.",reflective,home_office
E007,P4003,2024-03-02,08:45:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Slept in a bit, which was nice. But now I feel guilty. Should have started earlier. Opened my laptop and immediately got pulled into a crisis. Someone broke something in production, and I need to help fix it. This is the third time this week. I'm starting to think remote work isn't working for our team. We need better processes.",frustrated,home_office
E008,P4003,2024-03-02,13:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Loneliness. I miss seeing people. Video calls aren't the same. I miss casual conversations, coffee breaks, just being around other humans. I'm an extrovert, and this is really hard for me. I've been going to co-working spaces sometimes, but it's expensive and not the same as being with my team.",lonely,co_working_space
E009,P4003,2024-03-02,19:30:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Long day. Fixed the production issue, but it took all morning. Then had back-to-back meetings in the afternoon. Didn't get to my actual work until 5pm. Now I'm working late to catch up. This isn't sustainable. I need to talk to my manager about workload and boundaries.",burned_out,home_office
E010,P4004,2024-03-02,07:30:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Up early, which I prefer. Quiet house, no distractions. Made coffee, sat down, and got straight to work. This is when I'm most productive - early morning, before everyone else is awake. I can actually focus and get things done. Wish I could protect this time better, but meetings always get scheduled during it.",focused,home_office
E011,P4004,2024-03-02,11:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Kids. They're home from school today (teacher workday), and they keep interrupting me. I love them, but I can't get anything done. I've tried explaining that I'm working, but they don't understand. They're too young. I feel guilty for being frustrated, but I also need to work. This is impossible.",stressed,home_office
E012,P4004,2024-03-02,16:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Terrible. Got almost nothing done because of interruptions. Had to work after the kids went to bed, which means I'm working until 10pm. This isn't fair to anyone - not me, not my kids, not my work. I need childcare, but it's expensive. Remote work was supposed to make things easier, but it's actually harder.",exhausted,home_office
E013,P4005,2024-03-03,09:15:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Woke up, checked phone, saw urgent message from boss. Had to jump on a call immediately. Didn't even have time for coffee. Spent an hour on the call, then realized I was still in my pajamas. This is not how I want to start my day. I need to get dressed and have a routine, even if I'm working from home.",rushed,home_office
E014,P4005,2024-03-03,15:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Technology. My internet keeps cutting out during important calls. My laptop is slow and crashes sometimes. I don't have a proper monitor, so I'm squinting at a small screen all day. I've asked my company for equipment, but they said it's not in the budget. I'm using my personal equipment for work, which doesn't seem right.",frustrated,home_office
E015,P4005,2024-03-03,17:30:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Got through it, but barely. Technology issues slowed me down all day. Had to restart my computer three times. Lost work because something didn't save properly. I'm behind on everything. Tomorrow will be catch-up day, which means I'll be stressed and working late again.",frustrated,home_office
E016,P4006,2024-03-03,08:00:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Perfect morning. Woke up naturally, no alarm. Made a nice breakfast, sat outside with my coffee. Then I went to my home office and started working. No commute, no rush, no stress. This is why I love remote work. I feel calm and ready to tackle the day.",calm,home_office
E017,P4006,2024-03-03,12:30:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Actually, I don't have many challenges today. Things are going smoothly. I'm getting work done, my team is responsive, no major fires to put out. This is nice. I should appreciate these days more instead of always focusing on the problems.",content,home_office
E018,P4006,2024-03-03,17:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Great day. Productive, no major issues, finished on time. Went for a walk after work, which I never did when I commuted. I'm more active, eating better, sleeping better. Remote work has been really good for me. I hope we never go back to the office full-time.",happy,home_office
E019,P4007,2024-03-04,10:00:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Overslept. Had a 9am meeting that I almost missed. Jumped out of bed, threw on a shirt, logged in. Thank god for video calls where I can turn off my camera. But I felt unprepared and frazzled. Not a good start. Need to get better about going to bed on time.",rushed,home_office
E020,P4007,2024-03-04,14:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Meetings. So many meetings. I have 6 hours of meetings scheduled today, which leaves no time for actual work. I'm going to have to work tonight to catch up. This is ridiculous. Why do we need so many meetings? Most of them could be emails or async updates.",frustrated,home_office
E021,P4007,2024-03-04,20:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Just finished working. It's 8pm. I spent all day in meetings, then had to do my actual work after hours. This is not sustainable. I need to push back on meetings or find a way to be more efficient. But I also don't want to seem uncooperative. It's a catch-22.",burned_out,home_office
E022,P4008,2024-03-04,09:30:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Started with a team standup. Good to see everyone's faces, even if it's just on screen. Felt connected to the team. Then I dove into my work. I'm working on a project I'm excited about, so I'm motivated. Remote work is working well for me today.",motivated,home_office
E023,P4008,2024-03-04,13:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Distractions at home. My partner is also working from home, and they keep coming into my office to chat. I love them, but I need to focus. I've tried putting a sign on the door, but it doesn't work. Maybe I need to be more direct about boundaries.",slightly_frustrated,home_office
E024,P4008,2024-03-04,18:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Good day overall. Got a lot done on my project. Had some good collaboration sessions with teammates. Remote work is actually facilitating better collaboration in some ways - we're using shared screens and digital whiteboards more effectively. I'm feeling positive about it.",satisfied,home_office
E025,P4009,2024-03-05,08:00:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Woke up early, went for a run. Felt great. Then showered, had breakfast, sat down to work. I'm trying to establish a routine that mimics going to an office. It helps me mentally separate work from home. So far it's working.",energized,home_office
E026,P4009,2024-03-05,11:30:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Actually, things are going well. I've found a rhythm that works for me. I block out time for deep work, I take breaks, I communicate clearly with my team. Remote work has forced me to be more intentional about how I work, which is actually a good thing.",reflective,home_office
E027,P4009,2024-03-05,17:00:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Excellent day. Productive, balanced, finished on time. I'm getting better at remote work. It took time to adjust, but now I feel like I've figured it out. The key is boundaries, routine, and communication. I'm actually more productive than I was in the office.",satisfied,home_office
E028,P4010,2024-03-05,09:00:00,morning_routine,"How did you start your workday?","Checked email first thing, which was a mistake. Found out a project I've been working on got canceled. Felt demotivated before I even started. Spent the morning trying to figure out what to work on instead. Wasted a lot of time feeling sorry for myself.",disappointed,home_office
E029,P4010,2024-03-05,15:00:00,midday,"What's your biggest challenge right now?","Lack of visibility. When I was in the office, my manager could see me working. Now I feel like I need to constantly prove I'm working. I'm sending more updates, being more vocal in meetings, making sure I'm visible. It's exhausting. I shouldn't have to prove my worth constantly.",anxious,home_office
E030,P4010,2024-03-05,18:30:00,end_of_day,"How did your day go?","Recovered somewhat in the afternoon. Found a new project to work on. But I'm still feeling insecure about remote work. I worry that I'm not visible enough, that people will forget about me, that I'll miss opportunities. This is a mental challenge I need to work through.",anxious,home_office
