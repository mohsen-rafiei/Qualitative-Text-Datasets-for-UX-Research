R001,TaskMaster Pro,2,2024-03-01,Alex M.,"This app used to be great, but the latest update ruined everything. The new interface is confusing, and I can't find features that used to be easy to access. I've been using this app for 2 years, but I'm switching to something else. So disappointed.",45,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R002,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-01,Sarah K.,"Love this app! It's helped me stay organized and get so much done. The interface is clean, the features are powerful, and the sync works perfectly across all my devices. Worth every penny. Highly recommend!",128,iOS 3.2.1,iPad
R003,TaskMaster Pro,1,2024-03-02,Mike T.,"Crashes constantly. I'll be in the middle of adding a task and the app just closes. I've lost data multiple times. Tried reinstalling, didn't help. This is unusable. Fix it or I'm requesting a refund.",67,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R004,TaskMaster Pro,4,2024-03-02,Jessica L.,"Pretty good app overall. Does what I need it to do. The UI could be better - it's a bit cluttered - but functionally it works well. I'd give it 5 stars if the design was cleaner.",23,iOS 3.2.0,iPhone
R005,TaskMaster Pro,3,2024-03-03,David R.,"It's okay. Not great, not terrible. I use it because I already paid for it, but I'm not excited about it. The features are basic, and there are better free alternatives out there. Probably won't renew my subscription.",12,iOS 3.1.9,iPhone
R006,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-03,Emily C.,"This app changed my life! I was so disorganized before, but now I have everything in one place. The reminders are perfect, the categories are helpful, and I love being able to share lists with my family. Best productivity app I've ever used!",89,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R007,TaskMaster Pro,2,2024-03-04,Chris B.,"The sync is broken. I add tasks on my phone, but they don't show up on my iPad. I've tried everything - logging out, reinstalling, checking settings. Nothing works. This is a core feature and it's broken. Unacceptable.",34,iOS 3.2.1,iPad
R008,TaskMaster Pro,4,2024-03-04,Lisa M.,"Good app, but the free version is too limited. I understand they need to make money, but the free version is basically useless. At least let me create more than 5 tasks. That's ridiculous. The paid version is good though.",18,iOS 3.2.0,iPhone
R009,TaskMaster Pro,1,2024-03-05,Tom H.,"Worst app I've ever used. Nothing works. The interface is terrible, the features don't work, and customer support is non-existent. I've sent 3 emails and gotten no response. Save your money and look elsewhere.",56,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R010,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-05,Rachel S.,"Amazing app! I've tried so many task management apps, and this is by far the best.

R011,TaskMaster Pro,3,2024-03-06,James W.,"It's fine. Does what it says it does. Nothing special, but it works. I wish there were more customization options, but for basic task management, it's adequate. Probably won't use it long-term though.",7,iOS 3.1.9,iPhone
R012,TaskMaster Pro,2,2024-03-06,Amy P.,"The notifications don't work. I set reminders, but I never get notified. I've checked all my settings, everything is enabled, but still nothing. What's the point of a task app if the reminders don't work? Very frustrating.",41,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R013,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-07,Mark D.,"Perfect app for my needs. Simple, clean, effective. I don't need all the bells and whistles that other apps have - I just need to track my tasks, and this does that perfectly. Highly recommend!",76,iOS 3.2.0,iPhone
R014,TaskMaster Pro,4,2024-03-07,Nicole F.,"Really good app overall. The interface is clean, the features work well, and I like the ability to organize tasks in different ways.

R015,TaskMaster Pro,1,2024-03-08,Steve L.,"This app deleted all my tasks! I had hundreds of tasks organized into categories, and after the latest update, everything is gone.

R016,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-08,Karen T.,"Love this app! It's helped me stay on top of everything. I use it for work, personal tasks, shopping lists - everything. The ability to share lists with my husband is great. We can both add items and check things off. Highly recommend!",64,iOS 3.2.1,iPad
R017,TaskMaster Pro,3,2024-03-09,Brian K.,"It's okay, but there are better free alternatives. I'm using it because I already have it, but I'm not impressed. The interface is dated, and the features are basic. Probably switching to something else soon.",15,iOS 3.1.9,iPhone
R018,TaskMaster Pro,2,2024-03-09,Michelle R.,"The app is slow and buggy. It takes forever to load, and sometimes it just freezes. I've tried everything - restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, clearing cache. Nothing helps. Very frustrating. I need something more reliable.",38,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R019,TaskMaster Pro,5,2024-03-10,Kevin M.,"Best task app I've ever used! The interface is beautiful, the features are powerful, and it's so easy to use. I've recommended it to all my friends. Worth every penny. Keep up the great work!",111,iOS 3.2.1,iPhone
R020,TaskMaster Pro,4,2024-03-10,Jennifer A.,"Good app, but needs some improvements. The search function is weak - I can't find tasks easily. Also, I wish there were more sorting options. But overall, it's a solid app that does what I need.",22,iOS 3.2.0,iPhone
