It kept asking me to verify my address even though I've used it before. And the autocomplete didn't work properly - it suggested addresses that weren't even close to mine. I had to type everything manually, which took forever.",completed,mobile

I looked everywhere, but it wasn't obvious. I finally found it, but it was hidden in a dropdown menu. Why isn't it more prominent?

There were like 5 different options, but I couldn't tell the difference between them. What's the difference between 'Standard' and 'Economy' shipping? They both said 5-7 business days. Why are there two options that are the same?",completed,desktop
