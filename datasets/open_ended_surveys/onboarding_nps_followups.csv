Usually onboarding takes forever, but this was smooth and actually helpful. The interactive tutorial showed me exactly what I needed to know without overwhelming me.",power_user,3
R002,U2002,4,2024-03-10 11:12:33,"What's the primary reason for your score?","I'm still confused about how to use most of the features. The onboarding was too fast - it showed me things but didn't give me time to actually try them. Now I'm stuck and don't know what to do. I've watched the tutorial videos but they don't help much.",new_user,2
R003,U2003,7,2024-03-10 12:45:21,"What's the primary reason for your score?","It's pretty good overall. The onboarding was helpful, but I feel like I'm still discovering features. Some things aren't obvious, and I wish there was better guidance. But I can see the value, so I'll stick with it for now.",casual_user,5
R004,U2004,10,2024-03-10 13:23:56,"What's the primary reason for your score?","This is the best onboarding experience I've ever had.

Seriously, whoever designed this did an amazing job.",power_user,1
R005,U2005,3,2024-03-10 14:12:44,"What's the primary reason for your score?","I'm frustrated. The onboarding seemed fine at first, but now that I'm actually trying to use the tool, nothing works the way I expected. The tutorial showed me one thing, but the actual interface is different. I feel misled.",new_user,4
R006,U2006,8,2024-03-10 15:34:12,"What's the primary reason for your score?","I really like it. The onboarding was smooth, and I appreciate that I could skip parts I didn't need.

R007,U2007,6,2024-03-10 16:23:45,"What's the primary reason for your score?","It's okay. Not great, not terrible. The onboarding was fine, but I'm still not sure if this tool is right for me. I need to use it more to really decide. Right now I'm neutral - it works, but I'm not excited about it.",new_user,3
R008,U2008,9,2024-03-10 17:12:33,"What's the primary reason for your score?","I'm impressed. Usually I hate onboarding flows - they're either too slow or too fast, and they never actually help.

But there's a learning curve, and I'm not sure I have time to invest in learning it right now. I'll probably come back to it later when I have more time.",new_user,4
R011,U2011,10,2024-03-11 09:12:44,"What's the primary reason for your score?","Amazing experience. I was skeptical at first because I've been burned by bad onboarding before, but this was different. It was actually useful, not just a checkbox. And the tool itself is exactly what I needed. I'm already using it daily.",power_user,1
