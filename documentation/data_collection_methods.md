# Data Collection Methods in UX Research

This document explains how each type of qualitative text data is typically collected in UX research. Understanding collection methods helps you interpret the data correctly and choose appropriate analysis techniques.

## User Interviews

**What they are:** One-on-one conversations between a researcher and a participant, typically 30-60 minutes long. Can be structured, semi-structured, or unstructured.

**How they're collected:**
- **Moderated interviews:** Researcher asks questions and guides the conversation
- **Unmoderated interviews:** Participants answer questions on their own, often via video recording
- **Contextual interviews:** Conducted in the user's natural environment (home, office, etc.)
- **Task-based interviews:** Users perform tasks while being interviewed

**Best for:**
- Understanding user motivations, needs, and behaviors
- Exploring complex topics in depth
- Gathering rich, detailed feedback
- Understanding context and background

**Challenges:**
- Time-intensive to conduct and analyze
- Requires skilled moderators
- Can be influenced by interviewer bias
- Participants may give socially desirable answers

**In these datasets:** The interview transcripts reflect moderated, semi-structured interviews with task-based scenarios. Responses include hesitation, clarification, and natural conversation flow.

## Open-Ended Surveys

**What they are:** Written responses to open-ended questions, typically collected after a task or experience.

**How they're collected:**
- **Post-task surveys:** Immediately after users complete a task
- **Follow-up surveys:** Days or weeks after an experience
- **NPS follow-ups:** After users provide a Net Promoter Score
- **Feature request surveys:** When asking users what they want

**Best for:**
- Gathering feedback at scale
- Capturing immediate reactions
- Understanding satisfaction drivers
- Collecting feature requests

**Challenges:**
- Lower response rates than closed-ended questions
- Varying response quality and depth
- Can't probe for clarification
- May miss context

**In these datasets:** Survey responses are post-task or follow-up, capturing immediate user reactions and feedback. Responses vary in length and detail.

## Focus Groups

**What they are:** Group discussions with 6-10 participants, moderated by a researcher, typically 60-90 minutes long.

**How they're collected:**
- **Moderated discussions:** Researcher guides conversation
- **Task-based focus groups:** Groups complete tasks together
- **Online focus groups:** Conducted via video conferencing
- **In-person focus groups:** Traditional face-to-face format

**Best for:**
- Understanding group dynamics and social influences
- Generating ideas and solutions
- Exploring consensus and disagreement
- Understanding cultural or social contexts

**Challenges:**
- Group dynamics can influence individual responses
- Dominant participants may overshadow others
- Social desirability bias
- Harder to schedule and coordinate

**In these datasets:** Focus group transcripts show group discussions with multiple participants, revealing social dynamics and diverse perspectives.

## Diary Studies

**What they are:** Longitudinal studies where participants record their experiences over time (days, weeks, or months).

**How they're collected:**
- **Structured diaries:** Participants answer specific questions daily
- **Unstructured diaries:** Participants write freely about their experiences
- **Photo/video diaries:** Visual documentation of experiences
- **Mobile diaries:** Using apps to record entries

**Best for:**
- Understanding experiences over time
- Capturing context and emotions
- Identifying patterns and trends
- Understanding long-term usage

**Challenges:**
- High participant burden
- Compliance can be an issue
- Requires ongoing engagement
- Can be time-intensive to analyze

**In these datasets:** Diary entries are structured responses to daily prompts, tracking experiences over time with timestamps and context.

## Customer Feedback

**What they are:** Unsolicited or solicited feedback from users about products or services.

**How they're collected:**
- **App store reviews:** Public reviews on app stores
- **Support tickets:** Customer service interactions
- **Chatbot conversations:** Automated or semi-automated support
- **Email feedback:** Direct customer communications
- **Social media:** Public posts and comments

**Best for:**
- Understanding real-world usage and problems
- Identifying pain points at scale
- Tracking sentiment over time
- Understanding support needs

**Challenges:**
- Often biased toward negative experiences
- Varying quality and detail
- May lack context
- Can be difficult to analyze at scale

**In these datasets:** Customer feedback includes app store reviews, support tickets, and chatbot conversations, representing real-world user experiences and frustrations.

## Community Forums

**What they are:** Public discussions on forums, Reddit, social media, or other community platforms.

**How they're collected:**
- **Forum scraping:** Automated collection from public forums
- **Reddit posts:** Public discussions on Reddit
- **Social media:** Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook discussions
- **Discord/Slack:** Community chat platforms

**Best for:**
- Understanding organic, unprompted discussions
- Identifying trends and topics
- Understanding community sentiment
- Discovering unexpected insights

**Challenges:**
- May not represent all users
- Can be influenced by platform culture
- Requires careful interpretation
- Privacy and ethical considerations

**In these datasets:** Forum threads and Reddit posts represent organic, unprompted user discussions about UX topics and product experiences.

## Choosing the Right Method

- You need deep, detailed understanding
- The topic is complex or sensitive
- You need to explore and probe

- You're exploring ideas or solutions
- Social context matters

**Use diary studies when:**
- You need to understand experiences over time
- Context and emotions are important
- You're studying long-term usage

**Use customer feedback when:**
- You want real-world, unsolicited feedback
